Peter has a utility function U(x) = 0.003 x2 + x and David has utility function U(x) = 2 ln(x + 1), where x is money in €.

a) Report the risk attitudes of Peter and David and justify your answers. Using graphs is helpful.

Now consider three investment opportunities (lotteries) whose monetary values in M€ are described by the following distributions:

Lottery 1: Uniform between 10 and 100
Lottery 2: Normal with mean 150 and standard deviation 25
Lottery 3: A discrete PDF with distribution as given in the below table
M€	0	10	20	30	40	50	60	70	80	90	100
Prob.	0.05	0.06	0.15	0.03	0.08	0.12	0.1	0.13	0.12	0.03	0.13
b) Compute the expected utilities, certainty equivalents and risk-premia for each investment opportunity for both Peter and David. Make sure that the results you get are in line with their risk-attitudes. Provide the exact analytical answers for Lottery 1, simulation answers for Lottery 2, and spreadsheet calculations for Lottery 3.

c) Compute the 10% VaR and CVaR risk measures for each investment opportunity.
